# Collection Service - Configuration

There is two ways to configure your `CollectionService` :

- With the `CollectionConfig` decorator.
- By overriding default `getter` of `CollectionService`.

## CollectionConfig

`CollectionConfig` gives you an elegant way to define the configuration of your service :

```typescript
@CollectionConfig({
  path: 'movies',
  idKey: 'name'
  resetOnUpdate: true
})
```

The `resetOnUpdate` config you can choose whether you totally want to remove and entity and add a new one with the new state,
or, and this is default, when set to false, you let akita handle how they update their stores by design. Meaning if your new state updating the store, the keys that maybe got removed in the new state are still present in the akita store. So if you want the new state to be the only source of truth, set this config to true.

`CollectionConfig` accept a `Partial<CollectionOptions>` object as parameter that looks like that :

```typescript
export interface CollectionOptions {
  path: string; // The path of the collection in Firestore
  idKey: string; // The key to use as an id for the document in Firestore. Default is store.idKey
}
```

## Path Getter

Sometime the path is dynamic. If your service is targeting a sub collection, the path needs to know what is the id of the parent document.

In this case you'll need to override the `path` getter inside the class. Let's see how to do that with a `Stakeholder` of a specific movie :

```typescript
@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class StakeholderService extends CollectionService<StakeholderState> {
  constructor(store: StakeholderStore, private movieQuery: MovieQuery) {
    super(store);
  }

  get path() {
    const movieId = this.movieQuery.getActiveId();
    return `movies/${movieId}/stakeholders`;
  }
}
```

1. We do not need the `CollectionConfig` here.
2. We inject `MovieQuery`, the query of the parent collection.
3. We override the `path` getter by getting the active movie Id.
